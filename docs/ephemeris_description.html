<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>The JPL Solar System Ephemeris specifies the past and future positions
of the Sun, Moon, and nine planets in three-dimensional space.  Many
versions of this ephemeris have been produced to include improved
measurements of the positions of the Moon and planets <a href="#ref1">[refs
1,2]</a> and to conform to new and improved coordinate system definitions.

</p><p>The DE100-series ephemeris is in the B1950 coordinate system, the DE200
series is in the J2000 system, and the DE400 series is in the reference frame
defined by the International Earth Rotation Service (<a href="ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/iersexp.sup">IERS</a>).  DE200 <a href="#ref4">[refs 4,5]</a> has been the standard from which the Astronomical
Almanac tables are computed since 1984.  Updated planetary position accuracy is
generally available in more than one series.  For example, DE118 <a href="#ref3">[ref 3]</a> and DE200 are from the same data as are DE140 and
DE400.  As of this writing the latest data set is DE421.

</p><p>Planetary positions are generated by a computer integration fit to the
best available observations of the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets, and
five largest asteroids.  The computer integration involves step wise
computation of the position of each planet as determined by the gravitation
of all of the other objects in the solar system.  The planet's position is
stepped both forward and backward in time from some chosen epoch.  Minor
adjustments are made to the masses and shapes of the Moon and planets to
get best agreement with their observed position of the last 80 years or so.
The observation are mainly from transit circles since 1911, planetary radar
ranging since 1964, lunar laser ranging since 1969, distances to the Viking
lander on Mars since 1976, and, most recently, VLBI.  The computer
calculations have been extended as far as 3000 BC to 3000 AD, but positions
for the 1850-2050 range are the most accurate, of course.

</p><p>Subtle differences exist between the best ephemeris model coordinates
and the standard definitions of B1950 and J2000, between the coordinate
systems defined by star positions and the B1950 and J2000 standards, and
between the coordinate systems defined by stars and radio sources.  These
differences, which start at the level of a couple of milliseconds and a few
tenths of an arcsecond, are very important to pulsar timing and radio
interferometry.  Hence, one needs to be very careful about comparing
observations reduced on the basis of different ephemerides and coordinate
systems.  With care and consistency, all-sky accuracies of a few hundred
nanoseconds and a few milliarcseconds are currently being achieved.

</p><h2><a name="eph_cont">Contents of an Ephemeris</a></h2>

<p>The solar system objects or reference points for which barycentric
positions and velocities are specified in the JPL ephemeris are Mercury,
Venus, the Earth-Moon barycenter, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune,
Pluto, and the Sun.  The geocentric position of the Moon is specified, from
which the solar system barycentric position of the Earth or Moon may be
derived when combined with the Earth-Moon barycenter position.  The DE200
ephemeris also contains equation coefficients for Earth nutation and lunar
libration.

</p><p>The JPL DE-series ephemeris consists of computer files that begin
with a header, e.g. header.405, containing a few lines of annotation,
the ephemeris time span, values of many constants assumed by the
computer integration, and an index table that tells the relative
locations of the data for the different solar system objects in the
data blocks to follow, e.g., asc+2000.405.  Each data block contains
coefficients for Chebyshev polynomials <a href="#ref8">[ref 8]</a>
that specify each of the three coordinate values and, by numeric
differentiation, three coordinate velocity components for each object
over the time span of the data block, generally 32 days.

</p><p>Within a data block interval, any object, particularly the faster moving
ones like the Moon and inner planets, may have its equations divided into
subintervals to achieve the required accuracy.  Each object has its own
number of equation coefficients, but the number is the same in every data
block and subinterval for that object.  The number of coefficients and
number of subintervals for each object are specified in the header index
table.  All dates and coefficients are double precision.  The equations are
for solar system barycentric positions in kilometers and velocities in
kilometers per day.  The time independent variable is <a href="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/%7Erfisher/Ephemerides/times.html#TDB">Barycentric Dynamic Time (TDB)</a> in fractional Julian
days.  The data block structure is

</p><ul>
	<li>Interval start Julian date
	</li><li>Interval end Julian date
	</li><li>Mercury sub-block
	<ul>
		<li>Subinterval 1
		<ul>
			<li>X-coordinate coefficients
			</li><li>Y-coordinate coefficients
			</li><li>Z-coordinate coefficients
		</li></ul>
		</li><li>Subinterval 2
		<ul>
			<li>X-coordinate coefficients
			</li><li>Y-coordinate coefficients
			</li><li>	:
		</li></ul>
		</li><li>Subinterval 3
		</li><li>	:
	</li></ul>
	</li><li>Venus sub-block
	<ul>
		<li>Subinterval 1
		<ul>
			<li>X-coordinate coefficients
			</li><li>Y-coordinate coefficients
			</li><li>Z-coordinate coefficients
		</li></ul>
		</li><li>Subinterval 2
		</li><li>	:
		</li><li>etc.
	</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>Once the desired subinterval is found and the equation coefficients
converted into a three-dimensional position for the specified time, using
these positions is quite straightforward.  Getting the position and
velocity of one object with respect to another is a simple subtraction of
six vector pairs.  Finding the direction of one object with respect to
another is then a simple rectangular to spherical coordinate
transformation.  A more complete discussion of ephemeris use is given in <a href="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/%7Erfisher/Ephemerides/ephem_use.html">Using the JPL Solar System Ephemeris</a>.

</p><h2><a name="get">Getting the Ephemeris Files</a></h2>

<p>To set up a new ephemeris installation you need to obtain the data
files from JPL for the time ranges of interest.  The best way is to
FTP the files over the Internet as described below.  You can also
download the Fortran code for accessing these files from the same FTP
site.  A companion document to this one describes a set of <a href="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/%7Erfisher/Python/py_solar_system.html">C++ routines</a> for accessing and
interpreting the ephemeris so we will concern ourselves here mainly
with getting the data files.

</p><p>The FTP web site is
<a href="ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/ascii">here</a>,
or you can do an anonymous FTP from the command line with 'ftp -i
ssd.jpl.nasa.gov' and then cd to pub/eph/planets/ascii.


</p><p>Next, you might want to fetch
the <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/de421_lunar_ephemeris_and_orientation.pdf">latest
documentation</a> on the DE421 ephemeris.  It contains some detailed
information about the latest ephemeris, including accuracy estimates,
and a lot of useful references, some of which are listed below.  This
document does presume a basic understanding of the ephemeris, however.

</p><p>Now get the ephemeris header and data files.  You have a choice of
downloading either the binary or ASCII data files, but the binary files are
machine and language dependent.  If you intend to read
the ephemeris data with the JPL Fortran code on a byte-order compatible
machine, then fetch the binary files from the <a href="ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/bsp/">bsp</a> directory.

</p><p>The ASCII data files are readable by any machine, so those are the
ones we'll use.  For all but the most precise applications it probably
doesn't matter much which ephemeris data version you use.  If you need
data going back to the year 1600, DE405 is a good choice so select the
'de405' ascii directory on
the <a href="ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/ascii">FTP web
page</a> and download the "header.405" and the "ascpxxxx.405" for the
time periods in which you are interested.  The DE405 data files are in
20 year intervals.  For example, the file 'ascp1980.405' contains data
for 1980 to 2000 for the DE405 ephemeris.  The files are 6.2 MB each
in size.

</p><p><a name="asc2bin">These</a> ASCII files can be concatenated and
converted to the binary format of your machine for much faster access
with a program called 'asc2bin'.  The source code for this program can
be obtain from
the <a href="ftp://ftp.cv.nrao.edu/NRAO-staff/rfisher/SSEphem">ftp
site</a>, which contains code for a complete
<a href="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/%7Erfisher/Python/py_solar_system.html">python language module</a>
for accessing the JPL ephemeris data.  After compiling this file the
ascii to binary conversion requires these linux commands or their
equivalents in other operating systems:

</p><pre>$ cat header.405 ascp1980.405 ascp2000.405 &gt; asc_cat.405
$ asc2bin asc_cat.405 2450000 2460000
</pre>

where the last two arguments, 2450000 2460000, are the beginning and
ending Julian dates for the binary file created.  These dates must be
within the range of the ascii data files that were concatenated.  For
quick reference, the Julian dates for January 1, 1995, 2000, 2005,
2010, 2015, and 2020 are 2449718, 2451544, 2453371, 2455197, 2457023,
and 2458849, respectively.  Code for program for converting (month,
day, year) to Modified Julian Date (mjd = jd - 240000.5), mdy2mjd, is
also available at the
same <a href="ftp://ftp.cv.nrao.edu/NRAO-staff/rfisher/SSEphem">ftp
site</a>.

<p>The JPL folks have kindly provided some test results that you can
use to test both your ephemeris data and the code you are using to
read it.  These test results are in the 'test-data/' directory.
Download the testpo.405 file.

</p><p>You now have all of the JPL files required to use the C++ programs
to be described in the documents associated with this one.  If you
would like to use the JPL fortran code, get the source code files in
the 'fortran/' directory.  Compiling and testing this code is
described in the <a href="ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets">usrguide</a> document mentioned above.

</p><p>Depending on your interests, you may branch to a document
describing the <a href="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/%7Erfisher/Ephemerides/ephem_use.html">general use of the JPL
ephemeris</a>.  Two other documents give general information
on <a href="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/%7Erfisher/Ephemerides/times.html">civil and astronomical time systems</a>, and
the <a href="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/%7Erfisher/Ephemerides/earth_rot.html">rotational motions of the earth</a>.

</p><h2><a name="history">A Sketchy History of DE Versions</a></h2>

Here is a bit of history on the various versions of the ephemeris found in
the literature.

<dl>
<dt>DE118
</dt><dd>This was the best available planetary ephemeris as of 1983, spanning
the 1850-2050 time range, based on transit circle measurements since 1911,
planetary radar since 1964, lunar laser ranging since 1969, and Viking
spacecraft ranging on Mars since 1974.  Its larger time span companion was
DE102 <a href="#ref3">[ref 3]</a>, which covered 1411 BD to 3002 AD.  The
major ephemerides leading to DE118 were DE96, DE102, DE108, and DE111 <a href="#ref5">[ref 5]</a>.  All of these ephemerides, including DE118 are in
the B1950 coordinate system.
</dd><dt>DE200
</dt><dd>This is DE118 rotated into the J2000 coordinate system <a href="#ref4">[ref 4]</a>.  DE200 has been the basis for the calculation of
Astronomical Almanac planetary tables since 1984.
</dd><dt>DE125
</dt><dd>Created in July 1985 for the Voyager encounter with Uranus <a href="#ref6">[ref 6]</a>.
</dd><dt>DE130
</dt><dd>Created in October 1987 for the Voyager encounter with Neptune <a href="#ref6">[ref 6]</a>.
</dd><dt>DE202
</dt><dd>This is DE130 rotated into the J2000 coordinate system.  DE202 is more
accurate for the outer planets than is DE200 <a href="#ref6">[ref 6]</a>.
</dd><dt>DE403
</dt><dd>A new ephemeris <a href="#ref7">[ref 7]</a> aligned with the (J2000)
reference frame of the Radio Source Catalog of the International Earth
Rotation Service (<a href="ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/iersexp.sup">IERS</a>).  It it based
on planetary and reference frame data available in 1995.
