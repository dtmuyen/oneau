xx 1.  Modify DAOFactory to accept jdbc params as args.
xx. 2. Create test of DAOFactory to confirm it
3XX. Modify EphemerisServlet.init() to:
     a. get jdbc params from properties file
XX     b. initialize the DAOFactory
XX     c. get an instance of EphemerisDAO
XX     d. initialize instance of Ephemeris with the dao
XX 4. Modify Ephemeris to use a member dao instead of calling the factory directly.
5. Change UI to include appropriate date ranges, and to include option to select different ephemeris data.


BUGS
1. Missing ephemeris files: select * from oneau.EPHEMERIS_DATA where filename in (
 'ascp1800.405',
  'ascp1820.405',
   'ascp1840.405',
    'ascp1860.405',
     'ascp1880.405'
 )
	-- due to use of list in EphemerisDataFile, change to accept a list of filenames on cmd line
2. ascp2200.405 seems to lose some accuracy when reading data.
   -- seems to be a bug in coefficient parsing logic which skips first digit + '.' in coefficients. this only occurs
      in the 2200 file -- all other files begin with 0 + '.', which is not significant (?).
3. max observation_num is 99, but is expected to be 229/230.  Each observation should have a start & end date + 1018 coefficients.
   -- bug in the way that loader was reading observations -- assumed that an observation started with exactly 5 blanks,
      but could be 3-5 blanks.
